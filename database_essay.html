<h1>DATABASE DESIGN &#8595;</h1>

  <p class="big"> All of the data about Victoria Ocampo's networks that fuels my network graphs and visualizations is drawn from a select series of print materials: issues of her literary journal <i>Sur</i>, books published with her Editorial Sur, or correspondence that she wrote or received during the 1930s up through her death in 1979.</p>

  <p class="big">At the moment, this database lives in a virtual machine on my computer, but I hope to host it for public use in the near future. When I first embarked on my journey of gathering data and designing a place to store it, I was new to the world of database design. In light of the fact that my digital project centers around networks, or groups of connected and interrelated individuals, I initially drew my project as an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), which defines relationships between <b>entities</b> (people, places, things) and their <b>attributes</b> (characteristic properties of an entity). With respect to my project, an example entity would be “person” and the attributes of this entity might be “name,” “birthplace,” and “occupation.”</p>

  <p class="big">These initial sketches led me to a more nuanced understanding of database design, and also how to format and structure all of my datasets. For starters, I began by conceptualizing the tables that contained my data around specific modules, or shared groupings of information. I then identified key pieces of information that I wanted to convey in the database, and key pieces of information that I hoped to make searchable for a larger public. This abstract visualization of my data as an ERD led to the development of a relational database using the open-source management system MySQL, where I created the following tables, or entities (represented here with <a href="https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/davilajs">Davila.js</a>): </p>
