      <p>Victoria Ocampo (1890-1979), her world-renowned literary journal <a href="http://www.fundacion-sur.org.ar/revista-sur/">Sur</a>, and her publishing house of the same name, all loom large over Latin American cultural production in the twentieth century. As a member of an elite Argentine family, Ocampo was able to travel to Europe throughout her life. It was here where she formed close relationships with a large number of writers and artists. Although she quickly made new friends and contacts throughout the continent, who all expressed deep admiration and appreciate for her creativity, intelligence, and aesthetic sensibilities, Ocampo still felt that she was an outsider, which was only confirmed when many of these same acquaintances displayed their ignorance about South America: “Was Buenos Aires in Brazil? she was asked. Were the natives civilized? How did she stand the tropical heat all the time?” (Meyer 104). Fueled by her discontent with Latin America’s alienation and isolation from Europe, Ocampo launched the literary journal Sur that “would be a cultural bridge between the Americas, a forum for the best thinkers of both continents” (Meyer 107). Broadly speaking, she conceptualized her literary journal, and publishing house of the same name, as a way to connect not only North and South America, but also Europe and the Americas.</p>
